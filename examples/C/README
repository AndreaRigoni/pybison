This is a parser for ANSI C code.

To generate your python parser, type:
  bison2py c
or, if you want parse node classes to be generated as well:
  bison2py c -c

Either of those commands will generate an executable c.py file,
containing a Parser class, plus unit test code which by default
reads C source from stdin.
