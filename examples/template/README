The 'template.py' file in this directory is a working
but very minimal parser.

You can execute the file as is - the first time you
do so, it will automatically build and load a parser
engine library.

This parser does nothing except read a bunch of words
from its input stream, where a word is an alphanumeric
string.

Feel free to copy this file somewhere, and tinker away
to your heart's content. This may be for you the fastest
way to get a comfortable 'feel' of how PyBison does things.
