The javaparser.l and javaparser.y files herein were NOT written by
myself (David McNab).

javaparser.l was taken almost verbatim from an apparently public
domain version, found on the website of
Professor Dave Binkley
(http://www.cs.loyola.edu/~binkley/)
at the Department of Computer Science at Loyola College in Maryland
(http://www.cs.loyola.edu/)

javaparser.y was taken almost verbatim from the source code to 
the GNU gcj java compiler.
